    Calculate the fitness score for the entire FA grid.
    
    Parameters:
    - FA_lifes (list): List of life values for the Fuel Assemblies.
    - FA_energies (list): List of energy values for the Fuel Assemblies.
    - FA_temperatures (list): List of temperature values for the Fuel Assemblies.
    - w_uniformity (float): Weight for uniformity (difference in burn-up between neighboring FAs).
    - w_hotspot (float): Weight for hotspot penalty.
    - w_symmetry (float): Weight for symmetry penalty.
    - w_lifetime (float): Weight for lifetime.
    - w_energy (float): Weight for energy.
    - N (int): Total number of Fuel Assemblies (grid size).
